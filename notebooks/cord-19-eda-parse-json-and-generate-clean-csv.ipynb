      "Influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) represent a significant burden on public health and can be caused by 10 a range of respiratory viruses in addition to influenza virus itself (1). An ongoing goal of anti-viral drug 11 discovery is to develop broadly-acting therapeutics that can be used in the absence of definitive diagnosis, 12 such as in the case of ILIs. For such strategies to succeed, drug targets that are shared across virus families 13 need to be identified. 14 For the SPINT2 inhibition assays, trypsin (which typically resides in the intestinal tract and expresses a very 1 broad activity towards different HA subtypes and HMPV F) served as a control (41). In addition, furin was 2 used as a negative control that is not inhibited by SPINT2. As none of the peptides used in combination 3 with the aforementioned proteases has a furin cleavage site we tested furin-mediated cleavage on a 4 peptide with a H5N1 HPAI cleavage motif in the presence of 500 nM SPINT2 (Supplementary Figure 1) . 5We continued by measuring the Vmax values for each protease/peptide combination in the presence of 6 different SPINT2 concentrations and plotted the obtained Vmax values against the SPINT2 concentrations 7 on a logarithmic scale (Supplementary Figure 2) . Using Prism7 software, we then determined the IC50 that 8 reflects at which concentration the Vmax of the respective reaction is inhibited by half. SPINT2 cleavage 9inhibition of a representative H1N1 cleavage site by trypsin results in an IC50 value of 70.6 nM (Table 2A)  10 while the inhibition efficacy of SPINT2 towards matriptase, HAT, KLK5 and KLK12 ranged from 11 nM to 11 25 nM (Table 2A) . However, inhibition was much less efficient for plasmin compared with trypsin (122 12 nM). We observed a similar trend when testing peptides mimicking the H3N2 and H7N9 HA cleavage sites 13 using trypsin, HAT, KLK5, plasmin and trypsin, matriptase, plasmin, respectively (Table 2A) . With the 14 exception of plasmin, we found that human respiratory tract proteases are inhibited with a higher efficacy 15 compared to trypsin. We expanded our analysis to peptides mimicking HA cleavage sites of H2N2, H5N1 16 (LPAI and HPAI), H6N1 and H9N2 that all reflected the results described above (Table 2A) . Only cleavage 17 inhibition of H6N1 HA by KLK5 did not significantly differ from the observation made with trypsin (Table  18   2A ). 19When we tested the inhibition of HMPV cleavage by trypsin, matriptase and KLK5, SPINT2 demonstrated 20 high inhibition efficacy for all three tested proteases with measured IC50s for trypsin, matriptase and KLK5 21 of 0.04 nM, 0.0003 nM and 0.95 nM, respectively (Table 2B ).Compared to the IC50 values observed with 22 the peptides mimicking influenza HA cleavage site motifs the IC50 values for the HMPV F peptide were 23 very low. 24 .

An ongoing goal of anti-viral drug 11 discovery is to develop broadly-acting therapeutics that can be used in the absence of definitive diagnosis, 12 such as in the case of ILIs. For such strategies to succeed, drug targets that are shared across virus families 13 need to be identified. 14 For the SPINT2 inhibition assays, trypsin (which typically resides in the intestinal tract and expresses a very 1 broad activity towards different HA subtypes and HMPV F) served as a control (41). In addition, furin was 2 used as a negative control that is not inhibited by SPINT2. As none of the peptides used in combination 3 with the aforementioned proteases has a furin cleavage site we tested furin-mediated cleavage on a 4 peptide with a H5N1 HPAI cleavage motif in the presence of 500 nM SPINT2 (Supplementary Figure 1) . 5We continued by measuring the Vmax values for each protease/peptide combination in the presence of 6 different SPINT2 concentrations and plotted the obtained Vmax values against the SPINT2 concentrations 7 on a logarithmic scale (Supplementary Figure 2) . Using Prism7 software, we then determined the IC50 that 8 reflects at which concentration the Vmax of the respective reaction is inhibited by half. SPINT2 cleavage 9inhibition of a representative H1N1 cleavage site by trypsin results in an IC50 value of 70.6 nM (Table 2A)  10 while the inhibition efficacy of SPINT2 towards matriptase, HAT, KLK5 and KLK12 ranged from 11 nM to 11 25 nM (Table 2A) . However, inhibition was much less efficient for plasmin compared with trypsin (122 12 nM). We observed a similar trend when testing peptides mimicking the H3N2 and H7N9 HA cleavage sites 13 using trypsin, HAT, KLK5, plasmin and trypsin, matriptase, plasmin, respectively (Table 2A) . With the 14 exception of plasmin, we found that human respiratory tract proteases are inhibited with a higher efficacy 15 compared to trypsin. We expanded our analysis to peptides mimicking HA cleavage sites of H2N2, H5N1 16 (LPAI and HPAI), H6N1 and H9N2 that all reflected the results described above (Table 2A) . Only cleavage 17 inhibition of H6N1 HA by KLK5 did not significantly differ from the observation made with trypsin (Table  18   2A ). 19When we tested the inhibition of HMPV cleavage by trypsin, matriptase and KLK5, SPINT2 demonstrated 20 high inhibition efficacy for all three tested proteases with measured IC50s for trypsin, matriptase and KLK5 21 of 0.04 nM, 0.0003 nM and 0.95 nM, respectively (Table 2B ).Compared to the IC50 values observed with 22 the peptides mimicking influenza HA cleavage site motifs the IC50 values for the HMPV F peptide were 23 very low. 24 .
